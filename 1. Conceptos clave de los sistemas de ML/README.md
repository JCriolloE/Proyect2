# About Dataset

### Context
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

### Content
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

1. What problem addresses? This project explores how to classify credit card movements and determine whether it is a fraud or not, in addition to dealing with unbalanced data.
2. What solutions (notebooks) already have developed? In this notebook four classification models were explored, which are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree Classifier.
3. Which of all solutions contains the minimum necessary to train and save a model? It worked with the unbalanced data and the best model was selected, which wasLogistic Regression.
